# 👋 Hi, I'm Frédéric Maury

I'm a French **Full Stack Web Engineer & Technical Lead** with over 9 years of experience in frontend-heavy development, remote collaboration, and building real-world products. Currently based in Barcelona 🇪🇸, I thrive in culturally diverse, international teams.

### 👨‍💻 What I Do
- **Tech Leadership:** I lead frontend and full-stack development teams, helping scale apps, optimize architecture, and mentor devs.
- **Full Stack Engineering:** From backend APIs (Node.js, NestJS) to user interfaces (Vue, React, Angular), I build reliable, modern web products.
- **Remote-First Collaboration:** 100% remote since 2020 — async communication, strong documentation, and clarity are second nature.
- **AI-Assisted Development:** I use AI tools regularly to challenge ideas, debug faster, and boost productivity — without losing sight of engineering fundamentals.

### 🔧 Technologies I Work With
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- Vue 3, React, Angular
- Node.js, NestJS
- Docker, AWS, GitLab CI/CD
- MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- Design Systems & Component Architecture
